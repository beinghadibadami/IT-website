                    <h3>1. Digital Products</h3>
                    <p>Due to the nature of digital products, we generally do not offer refunds once the product has
                        been downloaded. However, we understand that exceptional circumstances may take place.</p>

                    <h3>2. Refund Eligibility</h3>
                    <p>We will consider a refund request under the following circumstances:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The product is not as described.</li>
                        <li>The product is corrupt or does not function as advertised.</li>
                        <li>You have not downloaded the product.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Processing Time</h3>
                    <p>Refund requests are processed within 5-7 business days. If approved, the refund will be issued to
